# Next Steps to Push to GitHub

## 1. Create GitHub Repository
- Go to https://github.com
- Click "+" → "New repository"
- Name: `temsa-pro` or similar
- Make it public
- **Don't** initialize with README
- Click "Create repository"

## 2. Add Remote and Push
Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your repository name:

```powershell
# Add your GitHub repository as remote
& "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe" remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Set main branch
& "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe" branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
& "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe" push -u origin main
```

## Example:
If your GitHub username is `Odiway` and repository name is `temsa-pro`:

```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe" remote add origin https://github.com/Odiway/temsa-pro.git
& "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe" branch -M main
& "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe" push -u origin main
```

## 3. After Pushing

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Vercel will automatically deploy your changes
3. Test the Turkish translations and role management fixes
